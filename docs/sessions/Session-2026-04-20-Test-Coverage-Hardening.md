## Summary

This session was a dedicated test coverage hardening sprint for cosmo-smoke, taking the project from 394 tests to 782 -- a 98% increase of 388 new tests across 10 internal packages. The work was executed through two parallel tracks: an Opus-driven worktree (ralph-002) contributing 174 tests across dashboard, schema, MCP, and runner packages, and a pipeline of 20 GLM agents dispatched in 3 batches covering baseline, monorepo, cmd/validate, cmd/schema, prometheus, TAP, push, chain, runner extended, runner parallel, runner watch, dashboard extra, JUnit, goss migration, MCP, detector, cmd/run, cmd/init, and cmd/root.

The ralph-002 worktree was the anchor piece. It produced 2,070 lines of test code across dashboard storage, schema validation edge cases, MCP helper functions, and runner parallel/watch execution paths. The quality gate process ran 5 review rounds before the worktree cleared at 8/10, with each round surfacing issues that required actual fixes before the merge gate would unlock. This was the first heavy use of the enforced quality gate pipeline where issues blocked auto-approve regardless of score -- the mechanism worked as designed: no issues were swept under the rug, and the final merged code was materially better than the first submission.

The GLM agent pipeline revealed a critical workflow lesson. The initial attempt to dispatch agents through `goralph` (the orchestration wrapper) failed -- agents hung or produced empty output. Switching to `ccs glm-agent exec` with explicit task manifests resolved this. The lesson is sharp: goralph adds orchestration overhead that breaks under high concurrency, while the direct `glm-agent exec` path handles batching reliably. All 20 agents completed, committed, and merged across the three batches with post-merge metadata tracking for each. The agent test quality was consistent for bounded-scope tasks (specific function coverage, edge case enumeration) and weaker for discovery tasks (detector Docker mocking, integration-level cmd/ tests), which tracks the established GLM heuristic.

Coverage moved from 74.3% to 75.1% overall, with cmd/ climbing from 20.2% to 25.6%. The modest overall increase despite 388 new tests reflects the reality that the runner and schema packages were already well-covered, and cmd/ integration tests require external process spawning that unit tests cannot exercise. The remaining gaps are structural, not effort-based: cmd/ integration tests need a test harness that can invoke the compiled binary with real subprocesses, and detector tests need Docker mocking for the container-running assertions. Both are bounded, well-understood tasks for a future session. The CLAUDE.md test count was updated to 782 to keep the project north star accurate.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Options Considered | Why This Choice |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Dispatch via `glm-agent exec` instead of `goralph` | goralph orchestration wrapper vs. direct exec | goralph hung under concurrent dispatch; direct exec handles batching reliably |
| 3-batch agent schedule (7/7/6) vs. all-at-once | All 20 simultaneous vs. batched | Batched allows mid-batch metadata sync and avoids 429 rate limits |
| 5 quality gate review rounds for ralph-002 | Accept at first 8/10 vs. iterate on issues | Enforced quality gate requires zero issues; each round improved the actual code |
| cmd/ integration tests deferred | Mock subprocesses vs. real binary invocation | Structural gap requiring test harness; not solvable by adding more unit tests |

### Remaining Gaps

1. **cmd/ integration tests**: Need test harness for compiled binary invocation with real subprocesses. Current cmd/ coverage at 25.6% reflects unit-level testing only.
2. **detector Docker mocking**: `docker_container_running` and `docker_image_exists` assertions require Docker daemon mocking or containerd simulation for deterministic test coverage.
