# Make run field optional for network-only tests

Currently tests require a run field even when only using network assertions (url_reachable, service_reachable, s3_bucket, redis_ping, etc.). Users must add run: 'true' as a dummy. Relax validation: if expect contains at least one network/storage assertion, run can be omitted. The test would skip command execution and only evaluate assertions.
