# Watch mode reporter state reset

# Watch mode reporter state reset

File-based reporters (JSON, JUnit, Prometheus, TAP) accumulate internal state across watch mode re-runs because they're created once and never reset. Additionally, open files aren't truncated between cycles. This produces corrupt/accumulated output after the first watch cycle when using multi-format chaining like --format terminal,json. Fix: either recreate reporters per watch cycle (move buildReporter inside runOnce), or add a Reset() method to the Reporter interface that clears internal slices and truncates files.
