# go test exclusion for GOrchestra archives

GOrchestra/glm-agents/*/files/ contains .go copies that break go test ./... with compilation errors. Options: (1) add GOrchestra/ to go.work exclude, (2) strip .go files from archives, (3) use go test ./cmd/... ./internal/... as the standard command. Currently using option 3 as workaround.
